Django API Project

Welcome to my Django API project! This project is aimed at developing a RESTful API using Django, allowing for easy integration with various client applications.

Introduction
This Django API project serves as a backend for interacting with data through a RESTful interface. It leverages the power of Django's built-in features along with Django REST Framework to create a robust and scalable API.

Features
API Endpoints: Define custom endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your data models.
Authentication and Permissions: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to your API endpoints.
Serializers: Use Django REST Framework serializers to convert complex data types into JSON for easy consumption by client applications.
Pagination and Filtering: Implement pagination and filtering to manage large datasets efficiently.
Custom Middleware and Utilities: Extend functionality with custom middleware or utility functions tailored to your project's requirements.
